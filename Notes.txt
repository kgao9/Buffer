How to allocate a page into the pool:
    get file to return an empty page
    get its page number
    allocate the buffer for it
    insert into the hash table
    set the frame
    update page
    
evict page:
    get frame
    assume ref bit isn't set and pin Cnt > 0
    if valid, check dirty bit
    if dirty -> write back
    clear frame
    (you could remove the page from the pool, but you don't need to because the frame isn't valid anymore)
    

For allocBuf, we want to implement the flow chart in the PDF up to the step SET. SET corresponds to allocPage, not allocBuf.

A note about header files.

These are like interfaces in java - they give you what the method will do and their inputs and outputs, but they don't have
implementation. This helps a lot because you don't need to read through 200 lines of code to find what you are looking for.

Note about seg faults:
    They are the devil. If you find one - good luck. You'll have to print out everything, and set break points. That's
    usually the best way.
    
I hope these notes kind of help. The first few notes should be the most helpful as it helps you imagine what to do.
